Hey There! Thanks for visiting my blog. 

I started this blog after realizing that I needed to improve my writing skills. A personal portfolio+blog website is also one of the best ways to reflect on yourself time to time and see how far you've come. This blog has now become a place to pen down my thoughts.

This website was setup using Jekyll and Vercel. It's so easy these days to create and deploy a website and this was fun to setup :). I personally didn't want to use sites like Wordpress/Wix since here you can get more control and learn some stuff about creating websites. 

Happy Reading!
