For the past few weeks, I've been reading this pretty popular book that  caught my attention when I was casually checking out books in a bookstore. 'Pyschology of Money' by Morgan Housel is a book thats on the front row of most bookstores. It discusses a few lessons on money, investment and risk with great exmmples and analogies. I personally enjoyed this book and would like to share some takeaways that I found helpful. It doesn't dwelve into any cheap tactics and false promises but really focuses on the bedrock principles of growing money.

**My Takeaways:**

* **Perception**: Each person’s perception of investment and money is different. What might sound crazy to you might be sane to that person.

* **Luck**: Luck is always a factor. One cannot deny it. You being in certain situations or eras or positions always matters. Focus on broad patterns instead of specific individuals because their story might have some weird luck.

* **Greed**: Sometimes you need just enough. Continously raising the bar to earn more and more money will eventually turn out to be a disaster. Do not risk something that you have for something that you don’t need. Happiness, family, freedom, reputation - dont risk them.

* **Compounding**: You must believe in the power of compounding. That’s how Warren Buffet made his bucks. Yes, you might do all your strategies to earn the lottery but it could be a one-off. The key is to be patient and consistent and compounding will take care of the rest.

* **Retention**: It’s not just enough to earn money. You need to be able to hold it too. Often success goes to people’s heads with tendencies to lose what they earned.  Your past strategy may not work again, be paranoid about losing what you have.

* **Outliers**: Tail end of a distribution brings you success. If you look at most people/companies’ success, it’s the odd tail that gives them the big success. Disney is a great example of this. You won’t win every time but what you do in moments of craziness will bring you so much success that all your average moments will feel like nothing. All you need is to win once and build on top of it.

* **Independence**: Realizing what money brings you is important. It gives you the freedom to control your time. Be it saving commute time, spending more time on health and not worrying about losing a job. That’s when you’ve achieved financial success.

* **Materialism**: No one is impressed about your material belongings. They are most likely putting that as the benchmark for them to reach success. You cannot earn respect by throwing money. Empathy, kindness and humility go a long way. Spending money to show your wealth is the fastest way to lose money. Real wealth is in your investments which you haven’t spent. If someone buys a luxury car, you can’t make an assumption that the person is wealthy, they are just rich at that moment. Since visual cues are easy ways to make judgements we often tend to assume richness = materialisim.

* **Investment**: Saving money is key to growing your wealth. Most of the times, it’s not about earning more money. It’s cutting your ego. Reduce your spending and frugal living can increase your savings which is more in your control. For that you need to stop caring about what others think. Save money without a reason. Most people think saving in terms of saving for a car, a house, a vacation etc. While that's still fine, you should also save for the unpleasant supriseses that can come your in life.

* **Unpredictability**: Investing history is not a great teacher w.r.t trends and events. The future can always be unprecedented. You cannot predict tail outcomes. You cannot prepare of it. Take COVID-19 for example. History does not take into account of today’s world. So take away only general trends ie what people did. Markets are driven by emotions which you cannot predict. 

* **Resilience**: You must account for a margin of error. What if things go wrong? Having that safety net allows you to take hits and come out succesfully in the long run. Use room for errors when investing. Avoiding single points of failure is key. That one bet, if it fails, you losing everything can be devastating.
