I'm a budding product guy learning the ways of consumer products and user behaviors. I enjoy learning UX hacks, growth tactics and product thinking. I'm trying to do this by reading books, online resources, listening to renowned product thinkers and practicing this at my workplace. 

I'm happy to connect @  <a href='mailto:rishi38199@@gmail.com'> my e-mail </a>
