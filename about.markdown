Hey there,

Thanks for checking out my blog. I started this blog to document my experiences and learnings to improve my writing skills. I've realized that I'm bad at it and writing blog posts is a way to get better. This is the way.

Setting up this blog also introduced me to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. It's great for blogs and easy to learn.

I'm a budding product guy learning the ways of consumer products and user behaviors. I enjoy learning UX hacks, growth tactics and product thinking. I'm trying to do this by reading books, online resources, listening to renowned product thinkers and practicing this at my workplace. I'm also exploring more of the AI tech thats taking the world by storm. Not that I'm new to it (been doing small projects on machine learning since college) but I feel the way we work is going change in the coming years and if you're not preparing for it, you're in for a rough ride.

Apart from this I love football (not the NFL type). I folllow Manchester United who sadly haven't been great since 2013. I also enjoy playing chess. Always curious to learn about anything related to science, technology, space, AI, history and geopolitics. I love animals especially cats and dogs so I will without shame say I binge watch short videos on cats and dogs quite often.

I'm happy to connect @  <a href='mailto:rishi38199@@gmail.com'> my e-mail </a>
