The past few weeks I've been trying to learn about design and product thinking. I believe that first principles thinking is key to being a good product person. Every great product solves a problem and delivers value. 

Take <a href="https://www.craigslist.org/">craigslist</a> for example, a popular site for buying and selling items. Craigslist generates around a billion dollars in revenue with a UI from the early 2000s. It isn't fancy but it does the job. This is a great example of a product that solves a problem and delivers value without all the bells and whistles.
