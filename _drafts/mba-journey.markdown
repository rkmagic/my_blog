I decided to do my MBA around the end of 2023. **Why?** I felt I needed a change in my life and to get exposure to new experiences and a new environment. I've been in my home city through the entirety of my life. It was also a chance for me to learn new professional/personal skills, learn about myself and my capabilities, and connect with professionals from across the world to get new ideas and inspiration. 

## The "Why": Defining Your Goals

Knowing the "why" is super important. It's not only a common question in MBA interviews but also a question that you and other people around you will keep asking. Having a clear goal on why you're moving to a new country to a new school paying hefty fees for a degree is a must before taking that decision.

Knowing the why will also help you figure out what you want from the MBA program. The value of an MBA these days isn't the same as 2012. With AI, dynamics are changing around degrees so it's really important for one to know what they want out of an MBA program.

* Is it to **build a network**?
* Is it to **switch careers**?
* Do you want to **start a new business**?
* Do you want to **strengthen your current career**?
* Do you want to **change where you work**?

These are all some good reasons to pursue a program. Again, the choice of the school depends on some of these factors. For e.g., if you want to move to work in the US, you would want to do an MBA in a US school. 

## The "How": A Step-by-Step Guide

Well, there is quite a bit of work needed to get into a school. 

### 1. The Exams
First are the two exams—checking your analytical ability and English language skill level. **GRE/GMAT** or university-driven exams (only some have it) are used by all schools. You can also get a waiver on the exam, but it is going to reduce your chances of a scholarship and selection (even if schools claim it doesn't impact your selection chances).

Getting a good score is the first hurdle. If you can crack anything **above 700 in GMAT**, you are in a good position to get into a top program. There are other parameters like your work experience and essays, but this is a first filter.

* **Cost:** The application fee isn't cheap (some Rs. 23k or $240 for GMAT). Giving it your best shot in the first attempt will save time and money.
* **Preparation:** The best way to prepare is to learn and do mock tests on the computer in a GMAT format in a time-based environment with progressive difficulty. Mock tests that are timed are vital to improve your chances of a high score.

Once you've done this, you also need to take an English language test if the MBA is delivered in English. **TOEFL** and **IELTS** are the two big ones. I've written on IELTS in this blog. Some schools also allow you to submit scores after your application up until a certain date.

### 2. Choosing the Schools
This goes back to your goals. Which region? What are you specializing in? The MBA school rankings provide a decent criteria on which schools you can choose, but you must do your own research about the programs and what they specialize in (e.g., some schools are known for consulting).

Prepare schools in 3 buckets:
* **Dream**
* **Good to have**
* **Safe**

"Safe" are the ones where you know it's fairly easier to get in compared to the other two. It's crucial to spend time on this because once you go to step 3, it's difficult to come back.

**Rankings that people usually see:**
* FT Times
* QS
* Poets & Quants

It is imperative to see the ranking logic before coming to conclusions. Moreover, rankings are just a guide. Talking to alumni, current students, and attending admission events will help you gauge more about the programs than a simple ranking. Some schools offer an **application fee waiver** (application fees range from ~$100 to ~$200) if you attend their admission events. Admission events include things like briefings about the program, interviews of alumni, Q&A sessions, etc. Try to make good use of them.

### 3. Application & Materials
Once you've finished the test and locked in the schools, it's time to prepare the materials for the application. You will need to decide which round to apply to well in advance so that you can work backwards. Typically schools have 3 rounds, but this number varies a lot.

**Round 1 is the best one to apply to** as you would be in the first pool of students and the entire scholarship fund balance will be available for you. As you progress through the rounds, filters start thinning your chances. If more engineering students, let's say, got in through the first round, then an individual with the same background might find it harder in later rounds. Schools try to balance class profiles across nationalities, professional backgrounds, and age to maintain diversity. Scholarship funds are also used up by 2nd and 3rd rounds.

These rounds are lined up targeting Fall intake (September). Some schools also offer Summer intake or even January intake. Additionally, applying earlier also means you will have ample time for your VISA application if you are moving abroad.

#### Application Materials
You will find them on the websites of the schools. Typically this involves:
* **Essays:** 3-4 questions relating to your goals, scenarios, problem-solving (usually **STAR format**).
* **Recommendation letters.**
* **Resume.**
* **Personal details:** Educational and professional history.

Essays are a big part of an application. It usually has questions like: *Why this school? What are your goals after the MBA? How will you contribute to diversity?* Some schools have a different mode of delivery where they ask you to prepare a PPT or a video answering some of these questions.

**A Note on Consultants:**
There are many consultants out there who can help you with this. **Note: Use consultants only for this part.** They usually charge a bomb (north of Rs. 3L or $3000) for the full counseling and support (shortlisting schools, essays, mock interviews). From my experience, they are only useful with helping you write and polish your essays. The rest is something that you can do better. Don't waste money on MBA education consultants in this day and age.

Be honest with the essays. Faking it will only get you so far. Using AI to help you write the essay is fine but don't copy AI content. Schools have AI flagging software and you can do a cursory check with free online tools like [ZeroGPT](https://www.zerogpt.com/).

**Recommendation Letters:**
Many schools follow the [GMAC format](https://www.gmac.com/reach-and-recruit-students/prepare-candidates-for-the-exam-classroom/common-letter-of-recommendation-lor) so it's easier for your recommenders if you are applying for multiple schools. Ensure that it is not conflicting with what you would have written in your application essays. 

#### Interviews
If you're selected for an interview—great news, you have crossed a huge step. The school has identified that you are a good fit for their program. Now it's all about talking to you face-to-face to understand the person behind the application.

It's mostly like a conversation where they ask you questions based on your experience, goals, character, and problem-solving ability. Speaking confidently and being cohesive with your answers should most likely get you through. This is a business school so they expect you to communicate well. MBA programs have coursework heavily revolving around presentations and class participation so it is important that you demonstrate **good communication ability**.

## Key Takeaways

To sum it up, applying for an MBA is not a simple and quick task. It involves months of planning and effort. If done in a phased and timely manner, it is very much possible to get into the school of your choice provided you have the credentials. My key takeaways of this entire process can be summarized like this:

1.  **Why MBA and What after MBA:** This is really important before you even start this process since this degree is quite expensive and might require quitting your current job and moving to a new country. The opportunity cost needs to be considered as you are spending money on the application, tests, VISA, tuition, living expenses, and not working in a job (some students do work in parallel but it depends on their company/family business). 
2.  **Know your level:** Understanding where you stand is key before selecting the schools. Yes, any applicant will want to join Harvard or Stanford but do you have the credentials to apply? Top score, good work experience with worthy achievements, undergrad education... basically, how good are you? I'm not saying don't be ambitious, but it's better to operate at a similar level. You will be competing with other students for grades and opportunities. Knowing what you can handle will make life easier. The expectations will also change based on the level of the school, so can you match them? Each school has a brand name and outsiders will immediately associate you as alumni with that brand once they learn about your school.
3.  **Treat it like a project:** Applicants are either working for a company or running their family business so managing time will ensure you don't rush things. Schools publish all the dates regarding deadlines to submit applications well in advance so try to fix on a round and work backwards on your process and steps. Taking the test, shortlisting the schools, preparing the materials like essays and recommendation letters. Each step has its own challenges and it's a linear process with little room to go back and forth between steps. If for some reason (work or personal) you are not ready with a good application for round 1, it's fine to push it to round 2. Submitting a half-baked application will do no good.

Do not fret if you cannot get in, there are always opportunities. MBA is not the only course in the world to reach your goals.
